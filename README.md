My zsh configuration.
=====================

* Forked from [paradoxxxzero](https://github.com/paradoxxxzero/zerorc)'s rc repo
* Using [nicoulaj's](https://github.com/nicoulaj/zsh-syntax-highlighting)'s zsh syntax highlighting libraries.

Also I'm using this as a means to learn how git works. Not to mention I balls up my shell regularly. So if you're going to try and use this, look out!
